BRIEF EXPLANATION FOR CLASSMATES
I made this file so that we could construct the statemachine from the ground up rather than editing Greg's files.
This ought to give us a greater understanding of the structure of the program, even if we end up copy/pasting
a significant amount of the code.

THIS CODE is meant to service the Vision System for Silkscreen Inspection as designed by group 21.5
It uses a basic state machine to control a camera, gantry systems, limit switch, and operating consol using an Arduino Mega and the SpeedyStepper library.
Camera: 
Actuator Model: FUYU FSL Series
Stepper Motor: Nema 23
Brain: Arduino Mega
